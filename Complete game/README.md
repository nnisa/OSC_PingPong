# Electron/P5.js Quick Start

A merger of [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)'s empty example and [electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start), providing the starting point for combined visual and computational JavaScript projects. Developed for [Large Systems](http://nas.sr/teaching/2017/large-systems/) at [Parsons](http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/).

Edit `sketch.js` and optionally `index.html` to write your sketch. To run, do the following in your terminal

```
cd path/to/sketch
electron .
```

Where `path/to/sketch` is the full path to the sketch directory on your machine.

The original README follows.

# electron-quick-start

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron in action.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](http://electron.atom.io/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start).
